Learn, only when you are humble. Everything that were past is not learning, but memories, experiences, and recollections.
Learning has no past, no future, but present.





There is no authority, no absolutely truth, no nothing. One is only free when they abadoned their authority. The old, fixed mind.
Do not let your past experience, knowledge, or tradition bind you.
"Be free, at the begginning, not the end"
