Fate is sometimes coincidental, almost magical.

Once I was a child, stuggling in every quarral.
I was weak and emotional, tried hard to control my self.
Now I am calm.
Leaving all the anger and sorrow to myself.
I am not able to hurt anyone.
So I became my own victim.
hhhhhhhhh, just kidding, what, do I look Im "EMO Girl"?
forget it
