We can prove nothing

Nothing

Nor even our existence

Everything on this world is a presumption

And based on this presumption, we build our civilization

So

Doubt everything

But also learn to accept what you agree

Accept what has not been proved

Cause nothing had been ever proved

The useless self has been killed in yesterday

I believe in myself

I believe in today

I believe in tomorrow

I could do anything.
