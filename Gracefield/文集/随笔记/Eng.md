Stars poured from the sky, lighting up the night.

It bloomed, giving the last strike of its life.

  

The world collapsed.

It broke into millions of pieces.

Scattered in the universe.

  

Is it the end?

Or the beginning?

  
  
  
  
  

==2023.04.20==

In darkness, chaos was rolling.

Suffer, endless isolation.

It growled and howled, pouring its anger to the world.

  
  

“Oh my child, the universe is cold. I'm afraid your heart will be frozed in that endless darkness."

"Don't ever turn back, do you hear me?"

" Don't show your fear, I can see it"

" The space is never kind to any of its children.

So be tough, my child."

Words, such a fascinating thing. It could easily tear souls apart, and rebuild them. It could be the magic of nature, it could do anything. But why, my dear, you knew it could kill me without a doubt, but yet you said those words.

Why?

"WANDERERS" LYRICS:

  

I see fire in the city lights

I see those souls buried in the concrete jungle

Bodies walking on the streets

And their eyes calling for salvation

Sleepy heads

Will ==they== ever ==wake again==

  
  

Oh wanderers

Have you lost your direction

Oh friend

Have you lost your courage

Running dusk till dawn

Feel your heart an==d let it take you go==

Like a bird

We could fly through the jungle

  
  

Fly through the ocean

Don't ask for destination

Feel the wind

And sail it free

Do you see

The ceilings have faded away

And now the stars will guide our way

  
  

Oh wanderers

Have you lost your dreams

Oh my friend

Have you lost yourself

The bold child you once was

==Oh Broken hearts==

==Don't be afraid==

  
  
  

Will you sing your soul

In this night?

Will you sing your heart

And tell your story?

Will you sing your soul

To the stars

Will you sing your heart

And let it be

  

I see hands

Begging on for mercy

I see fire in the city lights

I see those souls buried in the concrete jungle

Bodies walking in the streets

And their eyes calling for salvation

Fly through the ocean

Don't ask for destination

Feel the wind

And sail it free

Away from the city lights

The ceilings faded away

And now the stars will guide our way

What we feared is never death itself, but regrets, pain, sorrows and worries.

Death itself is not to be feared of, for when it is present, we no longer exists.

We can prove nothing

Nothing

Nor even our existence

Everything on this world is a presumption

And based on this presumption, we build our civilization

So

Doubt everything

But also learn to accept what you agree

Accept what has not been proved

Cause nothing had ever been proved
