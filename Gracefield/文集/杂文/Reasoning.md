I can't stop thinking about reasons and causes of things and nature. I seek for a resolution, an explanation. A reason to live, a reason to exist.

I couldn't stop, my brain drives me to think deeper and deeper. But the fact is:

Not everything in nature has an explanation, it might be compound and complicated.
