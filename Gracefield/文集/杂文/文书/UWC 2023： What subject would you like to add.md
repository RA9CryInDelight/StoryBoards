**I would like to add philosophy as one of the subjects in the Foundation Program.**

**Philosophy is the pursuit of wisdom. It inspires people to think about deep questions about selves and the world. I believe learning philosophy will help students to train their ways of thinking.**

**Learning from the conversations of ancient philosophers can inspire critical thinking, which in my opinion is very important to a high school student. There are no right or wrong, only beliefs and opinions. Every point of view has its own evidence and reasons. Students could learn from arguments and find out their own standpoints and even come up with their own questions.**

**On the other hand, the use of logic in conversations could also be practiced by learning philosophy. It could even be a beneficial rehearsal for future debates. Currently, I am learning ancient philosophy online. Not only did it inspire my curiosity about political and moral questions, but also leveled my logical thinking. And indeed, debates seemed easier than before.**

**Philosophy is a subject that could inspire critical and logical thinking. If I got a chance, I would love to learn it in high school.**
