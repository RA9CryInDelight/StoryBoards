**Explain your top 3 choices.** 

1. UWC USA

  UWC in America is knon for emphasizing community service. Giving and offering are always valuable lessons. Personally, I have also been engaging in volunteer activities, and would like to delve deeper into this field. Besides, I am interested in universities in America. By studying there, I could better prepare and plan for my future.

2. UWC ISAK Japan

 I have been to Japan once, and I found their culture intriguing. The way ancient cultures and lifestyles are passed on to the next generation is fascinating. Yet, Japan is one of the most modern countries in the world. It seems to maintain a delicate balance, which makes me curious. I have been learning Japanese independently for a while and believe that by next year, communication will not be a problem.

3. Pearson College UWC:  

Pearson College pays attention to student’s development as a whole person.  Having grown up in a Christian school, character traits meant a lot to me. I would like to learn more than just knowledge, but also life experiences and how to live as a whole. Additionally, the school is located in a forest near the ocean and has beautiful scenery. I think it will be a wonderful place to learn and be in touch with nature.
