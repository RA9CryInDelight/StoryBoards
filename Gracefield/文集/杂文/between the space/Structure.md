Chapter 1:

The red goldfish, it disappeared. I could not find it anywhere.

"Ah! Jesus had send a message! It is a miracle!"

Chapter 2:

A:

"The universe is full of miracles, and we are just a small dust in between. When a world is highly civilized, morality will appear. It protects the weak instead of preying it. The law of jungle are for the barbarians, savage and uncultivated. "

  

John:

"Funny, why would a highly civilized world protect those who are useless, it doesn't make sense. Wouldn't it distract their power?"

  

A:

"It is the act of protecting that manifests their power, my child. For them, it doesn't even requires the least of their power. For them, caring for the weak will be as easy as a blink of eye."

Chapter 3:

Teacher A:

"It is interesting though, Jumping between space occurs randomly in our universe"

  

Classmate A:

"John, would you chose physics as a profession in college?"

Chapter 4:

This is a strange place.

A world of white.

Where am I Where am I Where am I Where am I Where am I Where am I Where am I Where am I Where am I Where am I Where am I Where am I Where am I Where am I Where am I ……

  

Suffocated by terror

(About to jump)

Chapter 5:

J:

"Ah! He's lost, what a poor boy…"

  

D:

"Is that….???How did he came up here… Oh Jesus Jess! Why are you touching him! Do you realize that we are flying through Cherry nebula? And suppose we are the only ones assigned for this flight!"

  

J:

"Calm down, Dave. Maybe he was just loss in the space center"

  

D:

"…What a guess…"

  
  

(*John wakes, and the three of them began a hilarious conversation…without knowing each other came from a different space)

Chapter 6:

The three began to realize what they are experiencing is deviant. Jess took John for a tour of their future world……well, more precisely a tour of their future spaceship. Meanwhile, Dave searched for materials that could probably explain what they're experiencing.

Space jumping…… 2098

John Elliot Christopher

  

Oh my good space, this can't not true.

Chapter 7:

D:

"We must send him back"

  

J:

"But how? Are you sure he is John Elliot Christopher anyway?"

  

D:

"This is unexplainable……the whole thing, it is like if someone has planned this… However, let's try. If he really is John Elliot Christopher, than staying here would change the timeline.."

  

John:

"What are you talking about? I am John Elliot Christopher."

  

J:

"…"

  

D:

"Look this." (Hand over the visual screen)

  

Jess and Dave told John about how space jumping was hypothesized. John Elliot Christopher was the pioneer…

Chapter 8:

John was back. Back to Earth, back to (a place, where he jumped)

…….

Chapter 9:

The goldfish, I saw it, it went back to the ocean.

Back to the broad ocean.
